FSD-Capstone Project 1: E-Commerce App 

Website Name: A1Collection                             


I created the UI design of the e-commerce website, which the users will be using to browse and purchase the products. 
This is the first part of the product. 
Since I am only working on the front-end part of this project. 
I build an E-commerce website UI with the following pages: 

A] includes.html Folder:  In this folder contains two files
                                         1] header.html file 
                                         2] footer.html file
                                         
B] css Folder: It contains 1] style.css File with CSS style code

C] js Folder: It contains 1] main.js File with JavaScript code 

D]productPages Folder: It contains Files
